# PDF Sandbox
Generating multi-page dynamic PDFs from HTML can be a tedious process, involving lots of trial and error to make sure that formatting is correct in all cases. PDF Sandbox uses the [Paged.JS](https://www.pagedjs.org/) CSS print media spec polyfill to provide up-front renders of PDFs specified using HTML in the browser. By using this polyfill, we guarantee that browser-renders will appear exactly like server-renders, taking the trial and error out of PDF layout.
